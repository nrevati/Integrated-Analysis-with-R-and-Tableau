# Integrated-Analysis-with-R-and-Tableau

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the impact of natural disasters on the energy industry, utilizing FEMA data from 2004 to 2015. The objective was to identify the top four natural disasters affecting energy companies and their refineries across the U.S. The analysis was performed using Tableau, with a focus on creating multi-maps (also known as Trellis or Panel charts) for effective data visualization.

The project involved the following key steps:

	• Data Integration: Natural disaster data was imported into Tableau from a provided dataset. Additional data related to refinery locations of a selected energy company was manually added to identify affected areas.
	• Geospatial Visualization: Using Tableau’s mapping capabilities, I plotted the locations of natural disasters alongside refinery sites, applying filters to focus on the lower 48 U.S. states. Custom shapes (stars for refineries and circles for disasters) and color coding were applied to distinguish between different disaster types.
	• Interactive Filtering: Quick filters for disaster types and states were implemented, allowing users to explore specific disasters and their geographic impact.
	• Trellis Chart Creation: I created multi-maps to visualize the top four disasters impacting refineries. This involved calculating the frequency of disaster incidents and ranking them using custom calculated fields. The multi-maps were divided into quadrants to clearly show the distribution and frequency of these top disasters across the affected states.
	• Annotation and Insights: Key refinery locations were annotated on the map for clarity, and I provided insights into the specific disasters that had the highest impact on energy refineries. Further, the project concluded with the creation of a Tableau story, weaving together all visualizations to present a coherent narrative on disaster impacts.
	
Tools & Techniques:
	• Tableau for data visualization and multi-maps creation
	• Data filtering, calculated fields, and ranking functions in Tableau
	• Custom shapes, color encoding, and interactive filtering for enhanced visual clarity
	
This project demonstrates how geospatial data, combined with visual analytics, can provide actionable insights into the operational risks faced by the energy industry due to natural disasters.
