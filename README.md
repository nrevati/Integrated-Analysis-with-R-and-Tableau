# 🚢 Titanic-Survival-Analysis-with-R-and-Tableau

📚Project Overview
This project analyzes passenger data from the Titanic to identify characteristics associated with higher survival rates. We use R for data processing and advanced analysis, and Tableau for creating interactive visualizations to explore the results.

🛠️Technologies Used

R: Data preparation and advanced statistical analysis

Tableau: Interactive data visualization

RServe: Connecting R and Tableau

🔍Key Steps:

Data Preparation:

Clean and organize the Titanic passenger data.

Create useful categories for age, ticket class, etc.


Advanced Analysis:

Use statistical techniques to group passengers with similar characteristics.


Interactive Visualization:

Create easy-to-use dashboards in Tableau to explore.

Overall passenger groups and their survival rates.

How survival varies by gender, ticket class, age, where passengers boarded, and family size.


Identify Key Survival Factors:

Determine which passenger characteristics are most associated with survival.



📊Results:

Our analysis reveals two groups of passengers that have much higher chances of survival:

Group A:

Women

Traveling in second class

Between 17 and 32 years old

Boarded at Southampton

Traveling without siblings


Group B:

Women

Traveling in first class

Between 17 and 32 years old

Boarded at Cherbourg

Traveling without siblings


These findings show that being a younger woman in a higher ticket class, traveling alone, significantly increases one's chances of survival on the Titanic. The port where passengers board also plays a role, possibly due to differences in evacuation procedures or the ship's layout.

This project demonstrates how combining powerful data analysis tools with user-friendly visualizations can uncover important patterns in historical data, providing insights that might not be obvious at first glance.
